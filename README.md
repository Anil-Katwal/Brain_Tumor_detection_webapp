#  Brain Tumor Detection Web App
This repository contains a web-based deep learning application that classifies brain MRI images into four categories:

## 1. Pituitary Tumor

## 2. Glioma Tumor

## 3.Meningioma Tumor

## 4.No Tumor

The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deployed via Streamlit to provide a fast and intuitive user interface for medical image classification.
# Features
✅ Upload MRI brain scans and receive instant tumor predictions

✅ Streamlit-powered web interface (modern and lightweight)

✅ Model trained with TensorFlow/Keras


✅ Detects presence/absence and type of brain tumor

✅ Clean and modular codebase

✅ Uses Git LFS to manage large ML model files
